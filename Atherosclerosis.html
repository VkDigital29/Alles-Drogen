            <h3>Atherosclerosis</h3>
            <p>Atherosclerosis (or arteriosclerotic 
                vascular disease) is a condition where the 
                arteries become narrowed and hardened 
                due to an excessive buildup of plaque 
                around the artery wall. Plaque is made up of 
                fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other 
                substances found in the blood. Over time, 
                plaque hardens and narrows arteries. The 
                disease disrupts the flow of blood around 
                the body, posing serious cardiovascular 
                complications. Atherosclerosis can lead to 
                serious problems, including heart attack, 
                stroke, or even death. 
                Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic, 
                but over time, the walls in arteries can 
                harden, a condition commonly called hardening of the arteries. The word 
                atherosclerosis is of Greek origin and 
                literally means focal accumulation of lipid 
                and thickening of arterial intima (sclerosis 
                [hardening]). 
                Atherosclerosis can affect any artery in 
                the body, including arteries in the heart, 
                brain, arms, legs, pelvis and kidneys. As a 
                result, different diseases may develop based 
                on which arteries are affected. 
                Arteriosclerosis is the stiffening or 
                hardening of the artery walls. 
                Atherosclerosis is the narrowing of the 
                artery because of plaque build-up. 
                All patients with atherosclerosis have 
                arteriosclerosis, but those with 
                arteriosclerosis might not necessarily have 
                atherosclerosis. However, the two terms are 
                frequently used with the same meaning. </p></br>

                <h2>Causes:-</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>Atherosclerosis can begin in the late 
                    teens, but it usually takes decades to cause 
                    symptoms. Some people experience rapidly
                    progressing atherosclerosis during their 
                    thirties, other during their fifties or sixties. 
                    Certain factors that can damage the 
                    inner area of the artery (endothelium) and 
                    can trigger atherosclerosis include:-</p><br/>
                    <p>• High blood pressure<br>
                    • High levels of cholesterol<br> 
                    • Smoking <br>
                    • High levels of sugar in the blood<br><br>
                    Areas of the artery that are damaged are 
                    likely to have plaque buildup which can 
                    eventually break open. When the plaque 
                    breaks open, blood cell fragments called 
                    thrombocytes (or platelets) accumulate at 
                    the affected area. These fragments can then 
                    stick together, forming blood clots.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>High triglycerides:</b> Most fat in food and 
in the body takes the form of triglycerides. 
Blood triglyceride levels above 400 mg/dL 
have been linked to coronary artery disease 
in some people. Triglycerides, however, are 
not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol. 
<br><b>Diabetes:</b> Patients with poorly 
controlled diabetes, who frequently have 
excess blood glucose levels, are much more 
likely to develop atherosclerosis. 
<br><b>Genetics:</b> People with a parent or 
sibling who has/had atherosclerosis and 
cardiovascular disease have a much higher 
risk of developing atherosclerosis than 
others. 
<br><b>Obesity:</b> Excess weight increases the 
strain on the heart and increases the risk of 
developing atherosclerosis even if no other 
risk factors are present.
